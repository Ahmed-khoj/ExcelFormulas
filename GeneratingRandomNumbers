# The formula below used to generate random numbers until a specific result is met, albeit taking a huge computing power and time




Dim cell_range As Range
Set cell_range = Range("A1:A24")

Do Until Range("B1") = 0
    For Each cell In cell_range
    cell.Value = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(1, 24)
    Next cell
Loop

cell_range.Value = cell_range.Value
